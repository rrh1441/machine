## Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Create SwingStick Product in Stripe Dashboard

#### Option A: Simple Approach (Current Implementation)
1. Log into your Stripe Dashboard
2. Go to Products â†’ Add Product
3. Create product:
   - **Name**: SwingStick Rental (Requires Machine Rental)
   - **Price**: $10.00 (one-time)
   - **Description**: Use this description for your Stripe product:
     ```
     SwingStick rental for use with SwingVision app (not included). IMPORTANT: Requires machine rental - do not purchase separately. You must download SwingVision app separately (iOS only). SwingVision FREE tier: 2 recording hours/month with AI stats. SwingVision PRO: $179.99/year for unlimited features. Learn more at swing.vision. The SwingStick attaches to your racquet for enhanced tracking.
     ```
     
     **Alternative with basic formatting** (if Stripe allows some symbols):
     ```
     SwingStick rental for SwingVision app (not included) | REQUIRES MACHINE RENTAL - DO NOT PURCHASE SEPARATELY | Download SwingVision app (iOS only) | FREE: 2 hrs/month recording | PRO: $179.99/year unlimited | swing.vision
     ```
     
     **Ultra-concise version**:
     ```
     SwingStick for SwingVision app. REQUIRES MACHINE RENTAL. App not included (iOS only, free 2hr/mo tier available). $10 per rental.
     ```
   - **Important**: Enable "Adjustable quantity" so customers can order 1-10
4. Copy the checkout link
5. Replace `YOUR_STRIPE_SWINGSTICK_LINK_HERE` in `app/page.tsx` line 578

**Note**: This approach relies on customer honesty and clear messaging that SwingStick requires a machine rental.

#### Option B: Bundle Products (Better Enforcement)
Create combined products in Stripe:
1. **Single Session + SwingStick** ($50)
2. **3-Pack + SwingStick** ($115)
3. **10-Pack + SwingStick** ($310)

This ensures SwingStick is only purchased with a machine rental but requires more products and complexity.

#### Option C: Use Stripe's Payment Links with Custom Fields (Best for Simple Conditional Logic)
1. Create a Payment Link (not just a product)
2. Add both products to the payment link
3. Use Stripe's built-in features:
   - Add custom fields to collect information
   - Set up the SwingStick as an optional add-on
   - Use the "Adjustable quantity" feature

To create a Payment Link:
1. Go to Payment Links in Stripe Dashboard
2. Click "New payment link"
3. Add your machine rental as the main product
4. Add SwingStick as an additional product
5. Configure quantities and options

#### Option D: Full API Implementation (Ultimate Solution)
As outlined in `improvement.md`, use Stripe Checkout Sessions API with:
```javascript
optional_items: [{
  price: 'price_swingstick_id',
  quantity: 1,
  adjustable_quantity: {
    enabled: true,
    minimum: 1,
    maximum: 10
  }
}]
```

This provides the best user experience and automatic enforcement of the rental requirement.

### 2. Update Your Website
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Add SwingStick rental option with conditional requirement notice"
git push
```

## API Keys Needed for Full Implementation (Production)

When you're ready to implement the full system from `improvement.md`, you'll need these API keys:

### 1. Supabase
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
```

### 2. Stripe
```env
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_xxxxx
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_xxxxx
STRIPE_PRICE_SINGLE=price_xxxxx
STRIPE_PRICE_3PACK=price_xxxxx
STRIPE_PRICE_10PACK=price_xxxxx
STRIPE_PRODUCT_SWINGSTICK=prod_SqfKhYmsP8JyAv
STRIPE_PRICE_SWINGSTICK=price_1Ruy05KSaqiJUYkjIfOslVQW
```

### 3. Calendly

SENDGRID_API_KEY=SG.xxxxx
```

### 5. Application URLs
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_URL=https://yourdomain.com
```

## Current Limitations to Address

1. **SwingStick Conditional Logic**: 
   - Currently just shows a notice that it requires machine rental
   - Full implementation will enforce this at checkout using Stripe API

2. **No Session Tracking**: 
   - Customers can't see how many sessions they have left
   - You can't track who has used what

3. **Manual Booking Process**:
   - No automatic session deduction when someone books
   - No email reminders

4. **No Admin Controls**:
   - Can't manually add/remove sessions
   - Can't see comprehensive booking calendar

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Add SwingStick product to Stripe and update the checkout link
2. **Short-term**: Consider implementing Phase 1-2 from improvement.md (Database + Stripe API)
3. **Medium-term**: Add Calendly webhooks and email system
4. **Long-term**: Build customer portal and admin dashboard

## File Changes Made

1. **app/page.tsx**:
   - Added SwingStick rental section (lines 541-594)
   - Updated promotion banner (lines 119-134)
   - Added Image import for swingstick.jpg

2. **improvement.md** (new file):
   - Comprehensive implementation plan
   - Database schemas
   - API endpoints
   - Timeline and cost estimates

3. **summary.md** (this file):
   - Implementation summary
   - Required API keys
   - Next steps

## Support

For the full implementation, you can:
1. Share the `improvement.md` file with a developer
2. Use it as a roadmap for phased implementation
3. Start with the most critical features (session tracking)

The current implementation gives you a working SwingStick rental option that customers can purchase, while the improvement plan provides a path to a fully automated rental management system.
